Project description
===================


The project is focused on identification 
windfalls by cosmic snapshots using convolutional neural networks. 

As it yields from the preliminary study, it is very important to
pass images of ultra high resolution to get 
desired results and accuracy of windfalls identification.

The project utilizes Python-based computational environment and
uses Keras and Tensorflow to build and train a CNN.
